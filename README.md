# Instructions to run this :
1.You can directly copy from this ipynb file and paste in google collab
or jupyter notebook or any other similar thing.

2.To evaluate any single operation expression just draw that in paint 
and upload it on google drive or just simply save it and paste its 
address in 10th cell in the 1st line in cv2.imread('path')
and simply run.

NOTE:- you can even scan the image and do the same thing but its recommended 
to draw in paint and do because due to bad picture quality the classifier 
may not identify the numbers or symbols correctly.
